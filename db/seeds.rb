  content: "AdvertisementTKTKSupported byTKTKThe podcast premiered during the pandemic and brought friends — and the friends you wish you had — together.TKTKBy Nathan Taylor PembertonTKTKDuring the confusing early days of the pandemic in spring 2020, there were a number of attempts at forging human connection, some more regrettable than others: things like the Houseparty app, socially distanced comedy specials, nightly essential worker celebrations, not to mention the social hegemon, Zoom.TKTKAnd, of course, there were pandemic podcasts, which covered everything from the scariness of daily news to celebrations of minor tasks to quarantine-themed close reads of the “Twilight” series. More than a year later, many such shows have gone dark, as the world eagerly moves on.TKTKOne exception to the boom and bust of the quarantine content cycle is the podcast “How Long Gone.” The show, which premiered in March 2020, was born out of a Twitter joke between Chris Black and Jason Stewart. Longtime friends, they began posting, three times a week, hourlong FaceTime calls with each other and a grab bag of famous-ish friends and acquaintances in media, fashion, music and film. Early guests included the actress Tavi Gevinson, the writer Cat Marnell, the singer Phoebe Bridgers and the playwright and screenwriter Jeremy O. Harris.TKTKNow, more than 200 episodes later, “How Long Gone” has become a staple for many media insiders, culture makers, very online people and even your average “bro” — making it a clubhouse for the chattering classes.TKTKIts mix of Twitter-centric water cooler talk, free-form bull session, and a deluge of takes “sprayed” by its hosts has pushed the podcast to outgrow its origin story. Within months of their first episode, the show reached monthly listener figures in the six digits, they cracked the top 50 on Apple’s comedy charts and were asked to host a new podcast for Spotify: “How Long Gone Radio.”TKTKIt’s even earned them a special kind of celebrity.TKTK“People at Erewhon are starting to recognize us,” said Mr. Black, 39, of the trendy grocery store in Los Angeles, where he and Mr. Stewart live.TKTK“How Long Gone” billed itself as a “bicoastal elite podcast from old friends” in its inaugural episode. There is, to be sure, some truth to the bicoastal elite thing. Mr. Black works as a consultant for fashion brands like Thom Browne and writes for culture magazines; he keeps an apartment in New York City, where he used to live. And Mr. Stewart, 41, is a prolific podcaster on his own, having first made his name as a party D.J. with Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak crew in the early 2000s.TKTKDuring one recent episode featuring A.J. Daulerio, a former editor of Gawker and Deadspin, the pair opened the show by covering a spree of trending topics: a viral milk story published on Grub Street, milk crate challenges and the appearance of one of Mr. Black’s tweets (about the milk story) in a New York Post story.TKTK“The milk story was brilliant because everyone has an opinion on it,” Mr. Black said during the episode. “And it’s absolutely meaningless.”TKTKOnce the giggling and verbal horseplay subsided, they yielded the floor to Mr. Daulerio, who talked about the drug abuse that marked his reign at Gawker and about his new Substack, which focuses on subjects like substance abuse and recovery. (Mr. Black sometimes uses the podcast to speak openly about his past struggles with drug abuse and his current sobriety.)TKTKTheir conversation soon settled into a broader discussion of New York publishing, their preferred newsletter subscriptions and media consumption habits. Mr. Black is fond of print magazines and Airmail, Graydon Carter’s once-a-week email newsletter. Mr. Stewart is less interested in print media and prefers to listen to articles on the Pocket app.TKTK“This is my favorite New York media podcast,” Mr. Daulerio said at one point. He added with some wonder: “You guys can say ‘fire’ and ‘bro’ so effortlessly.”TKTKAttributing the show’s steady success to its insider-baseball-like chats or the hosts’ exaggerated takes on just about everything under the sun would miss the point. There’s likely a more simple explanation: the appeal of two grown men engaging in nontoxic masculinity.TKTK“It’s rare and special and eternally fun to listen to people who are really close, who can point out each other’s flaws in a healthy and positive way,” Mr. Stewart said, on a recent Zoom call with Mr. Black. “Negativity is not entertaining to us.”TKTKMr. Black added: “Just in a lighthearted, fun way. I like punching up.”TKTKThey are, of course, far from the first pair of friends to turn genuine rapport into digestible content. Last November, Vogue cited “How Long Gone” as proof of the rise of the “bro-cast,” but noted that the format had been popularized quite successfully by women-led shows like “Call Your Girlfriend,” hosted by two “long-distance besties,” long before the quarantine era.TKTKAnother podcast built around a close personal rapport is “Red Scare,” hosted by Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova. The podcast’s focus is political and generally takes up a trolling critique of liberal feminism in all its forms, but Ms. Nekrasova attributes a large degree of the show’s success to the friendship that is centered in each episode. She came on “How Long Gone” last November after receiving an Instagram message from Mr. Black, whom she knew little about.TKTKAnd with so many podcasts operating like mere “friendship simulators,” as Ms. Nekrasova calls them, she was surprised by the ease with which Mr. Black and Mr. Stewart integrated her into their pop culture musings. “It’s clear what they have is real,” she said. “Most podcasts take a while to develop a friendship, especially when it’s front and center to the show. But it’s easy for them. They’re good at keeping that ball in the air.”TKTKAt a ceaseless pace, they have leveraged their micro-celebrity to pursue their own low-stakes interests. Multiple runs of hats, tote bags and a $40 “Performance” Nalgene bottle — mostly designed by Mr. Stewart — have sold out, they said. They have released their own brand of “snapchilled” canned coffee, named Mudd, and for a short while, Angelenos could start their day with “the Goner,” a vegan breakfast sandwich made in collaboration with local chain Burgerlords.TKTKStill, they haven’t put their podcast behind a paywall, opting for more aesthetically aligned sponsorships with companies like the podcasting platform Anchor.FM. “We want as many people to hear this podcast as possible, and if you put a paywall up that’s not going to happen,” Mr. Black said.TKTK“People don’t really want to support us that much,” Mr. Stewart added, dryly.TKTKNor have they fully abandoned their day jobs. Mr. Stewart consults for other podcasts, while Mr. Black works with fashion clients. With audiences hyper-attuned to all things that could be deemed performative, and listeners and viewers ever more cynical to the dynamics of self-branding, Mr. Black and Mr. Stewart seem to have dialed into the right frequency of realness.TKTK“There are loads of podcasts that are intelligent and well researched, but they don’t necessarily have people I wish I was hanging out with,” said Raven Smith, a columnist for Vogue, who has been a guest on the show.TKTKIt was through a Thom Browne project that Mr. Harris, the writer, first met Mr. Black. The two quickly hit it off and Mr. Harris was invited onto the podcast, becoming one of its earliest guests.TKTK“There’s a casual intellect that moves past a lot of the performance that one sees in podcasts,” Mr. Harris said of the show’s hosts. “They have an overwhelming sense of curiosity in who you are and the world you’re a part of. And that’s what sets them apart. They are classic radio hosts.”TKTKMr. Black and Mr. Stewart have yet to record an episode in the same room. However, this fall, they are planning to take the show into the real world after being signed by High Road Touring, a talent booking agency. “Goners,” as the show’s fans are referred to, will be able to see a “David Letterman-style” live show during an 11-city tour across the country. An Oct. 23 appearance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York is sold out.TKTKThe podcast has a record deal now, too, with the independent label Jagjaguar, home to Bon Iver, Angel Olsen and other musicians. Jagjaguar will release the debut “How Long Gone” album as a part of its 25th anniversary celebration.TKTKBoth hosts came of age toiling in the music industry — Mr. Black used to manage the pop punk band Cartel in the early 2000s — so their record deal fits squarely with their history.TKTKAnd more broadly, it also may indicate that a successful podcast, in a cultural moment marked by digital novelty, is a quick path to social cachet.TKTK“Through the pod we’ve been able to clearly see how to accomplish a lot of the dreams and goals in our lives,” Mr. Stewart said. “We’ve been able to pull from all the worlds we’ve been a part of and inject it into this experiment that we’re doing. Every little thing can be done the way you want to do it.”TKTKMuch like their music industry debut, which, Mr. Black noted, will be released as a double compact disc.TKTK“It’s just a fun thing to do,” he said. “Tapes are corny. Vinyl is corny. CDs are cool.”TKTKAdvertisementTKTK",

  content: "The playful capsule includes cashmere knits, velvet shoes and hacky sacks filled with pearl couscous. TKTKOn a Monday afternoon in September—just after the first day of school had let out—nine tiny models were milling around Brooklyn’s Herbert Von King Park in layers of Italian cashmere. The kids, a creative bunch, none of whom does this professionally, seemed remarkably unfazed by the flurry of activity that accompanies a fashion shoot: As photography and styling assistants flitted around them, they sipped from juice boxes, shared their Transformers, and scattered cheese snacks on the ground. Louie Nobuko Huelster, 5 years old, tested the durability of a pair of green velvet shoes by jumping from one row of bleachers to the next. A few others wriggled out of their knit pants when their parents weren’t looking.TKTKEven when approached by a masked stranger with a voice recorder, the kids maintained their cool. I asked Coralynn Agbasionwe, 5, how her outfit made her feel. “It makes me feel happy,” she told me, playing with the belt of a blue cardigan. “I only just tried it on, but I would wear it for, like, a Valentine’s Day. Normally, I wear dresses on Valentine’s Day, and then I put a little sweater on the top.” Seven-year-old Ava Lamb said she’d wear her turmeric-hued pants “to a party.” Like a birthday party? “No,” she said matter-of-factly. “Just a party.”TKTKThe designers of these cozy, colorful ensembles are Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of the Row, the brand whose minimalist, trend-agnostic adult clothes occupy a very specific niche in the world of luxury fashion. Where other designers are constantly pivoting, piling on, and riffing off of one another, the Olsens remain monastically consistent. The Row’s first children’s capsule collection, which launches in their stores and on their website today, stays true to that philosophical core: “The items have to have a sense of practicality, ease, and comfort,” Mary-Kate told me. “We think of this for our main collections, but it’s even more important for kids. Over the past 10 years, we’ve personalized cashmere onesie and blanket sets for our clients and friends who have had kids. We wanted to explore that in a bigger way.” While neither of the 35-year-old sisters has children of her own, a lot of their friends have had kids during the pandemic, which helped spark the idea.TKTKFrom left: Monreau Paretti, Alasdair Browne, Coralynn Agbasionwe, Brontë Schneider, Langston Rhinehart-Williams, Dev Cope, Ava Lamb, Leo Arya Kelley, Louie Nobuko Huelster.  TKTKThe models wear the Row throughout.TKTKGrooming by Ren Nobuko Huelster for the Wall Group; casting by Dionne Cochrane; casting assistant: Sydney Smith; photo assistants: Jordan Zuppa, Josh Matthews; stylist assistants: Rosalie Moreland, Andy Polanco, Jenna Wojciechowski, Amir La Sure. Talent: Alasdair Browne, Ava Lamb, Brontë Schneider, Coralynn Agbasionwe, Dev Cope, Langston Rhinehart-Williams, Leo Arya Kelley, Louie Nobuko Huelster, Monreau ParettiTKTKThe collection is made up of cashmere pants, crewnecks, belted cardigans, hats, and velvet slip-ons (a miniature version of an existing women’s style, and based on Venetian gondolier shoes). It ranges in size from 2 to 10 years, and in price from $390 to $790. Also in the mix: small cashmere hacky sacks, an extremely chic upgrade on a ’90s college campus staple. Unlike the conventional ones, which are stuffed with plastic beads, these are filled with pearl couscous. At the shoot, at least one model enjoyed pelting them at our creative director.TKTKNone of the pieces is gendered—a refreshing departure from the norm. (Enter just about any children’s clothing store, and you’ll feel like you’ve stepped into a battle of ruffled florals and monster trucks.) “Kids are the heart of creativity,” Ashley said. “They should be able to pick and choose what they want to wear, no matter what.” Everything is also devoid of zippers, buttons, laces, and anything else that might make the clothes less comfortable, or make getting them on and off more difficult than it needs to be. Those features, along with the cheerful but still sophisticated color palette, were born out of conversations with tots throughout the design process. “Kids bring out a sense of playfulness. They were very vocal and opinionated about what they liked and didn’t like,” Mary-Kate noted. “We loved listening to their free minds.”TKTKThe capsule also has a philanthropic element: Proceeds will be donated to charities in Los Angeles, New York, and London (cities where the Row has flagship stores) that support children’s health, education, and well-being. With successive collections, which will expand to become “a reflection of core and seasonal offerings,” per Mary-Kate, the Olsens hope to build upon their network. “The plan is to create a program that gives back in a significant and meaningful way,” Ashley said.TKTKSo does that mean we’ll eventually see toddlers around Greenwich Village and Notting Hill wearing suede trousers and soft-shouldered merino wool coats? “We started the Row with a T-shirt,” Ashley noted. “This collection was started in a similar way—we are focusing on the basics and building from there.”TKTK",

  content: "Every product is independently selected by (obsessive) editors. Things you buy through our links may earn us a commission.TKTKThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.TKTKSimone Biles has a keen air sense, the ability to let muscle memory pilot against the brain’s logical judgment. She can clear her mind and think of absolutely nothing. Catlike in her reflexes, she locates herself in space and lands on her feet every time. This has been the mark of her genius since childhood, the thing that made her different. Watching her is like trying to catch light. You think, Did that just happen? She flies higher and is more nimble than her competition, with more room for failure because what she attempts is that much more difficult. She has beaten the records of her idols — Nastia Liukin, Shawn Johnson, Alicia Sacramone — and they think she’s the undeniable greatest too. She’s what superheroes are made of, except she’s made of bones and muscles that strain and break.TKTKThis time, though, the break wasn’t a bone; it was something in her spirit, an injury that could not be explained by CAT scan or X-ray. The past few years had been the most trying stretch of her personal and professional life. In 2018, Biles revealed she had been sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar; the organization she was winning medals for had covered up his crimes. Still, going into the Tokyo Olympics in the summer of 2021, after a successful competitive year, she expected things to go as they always did. Then, on the fifth day of competition, she pushed off the vault and discovered she couldn’t see herself in her head, couldn’t see the map of the floor in order to land. It wasn’t just unexpected — it was terrifying. She immediately withdrew from the finals. “My perspective has never changed so quickly from wanting to be on a podium to wanting to be able to go home, by myself, without any crutches,” Biles tells me over brunch at a hotel facing the south side of Central Park in early September.TKTKToday, the 24-year-old gymnast is radiant and relaxed, her face lightly dressed with makeup. She’s wearing a crisp white T-shirt that looks like it was pulled straight off a Uniqlo shelf. She suggests mimosas. It’s 10 a.m., but why not? The ease of postseason Simone Biles is an art. In the months when she’s competing or preparing to compete, she’s focused, regimented. Today, she seems more open to going with the flow. Life is no less busy, but the stakes are much lower. She has just begun rehearsals for Athleta’s Gold Over America, a nationwide gymnastics tour that she stars in; in a few days, she will present at the VMAs and walk the Met Gala red carpet. We chat about matcha and Telfar. In conversation, she is reflective and warm and has a bighearted laugh. It is easy to see why little girls scream when she walks into the room.TKTKWhile Biles is generally honest about her feelings, she is skilled at presenting them in a rehearsed package. When we approach the subject of Tokyo, it begins that way. “You know, there have been highs, there have been lows,” she says, sending her gaze up toward the ceiling as she considers the stakes of the discussion. As she continues, she no longer seems interested in being quite as careful. “Sometimes it’s like, yeah, I’m perfectly okay with it. Like, that’s how it works. That’s how it panned out.” She flips her 1b-colored, bra-length jumbo box braids over her shoulder. “And then other times I’ll just start bawling in the house.”TKTKBiles is naturally inclined toward humility — she likes people to know she is a glass-half-full kind of girl — but when she talks about the narratives that critics spread during Tokyo, her indignation builds. She recounts the absurdity of some of the assumptions the public made about her performance, Twitter threads accusing her of giving up because she just didn’t feel like competing. “If I still had my air awareness, and I just was having a bad day, I would have continued,” Biles says. “But it was more than that.”TKTKAfter training for most of her life for these Olympic Games, after a grueling season, after years of discussing her abuser publicly — how could anyone think the Games went the way they did because she just didn’t feel like showing up? How could they think that after all this time, all this effort, she would travel all the way to Tokyo to just quit?TKTK“Say up until you’re 30 years old, you have your complete eyesight,” Biles says. “One morning, you wake up, you can’t see shit, but people tell you to go on and do your daily job as if you still have your eyesight. You’d be lost, wouldn’t you? That’s the only thing I can relate it to. I have been doing gymnastics for 18 years. I woke up — lost it. How am I supposed to go on with my day?”TKTKBiles knows she is the greatest. She has had four gymnastics elements named after her — one on beam, one on vault, two on floor. With a combined total of 32 Olympic and World Championships medals, she is the most decorated gymnast of all time. “It’s kind of unheard of to win as many things as I have,” Biles says. “I don’t physically understand how I do it.” She seems genuinely bummed she can’t answer the question. Is it mental? Is it physical? If she knew what it was, she could bottle it up and sell it. “No,” she concludes. “It was a God-given talent.”TKTKFor an athlete of Biles’s ability, the mind remains the most important organ. It tells the body what to do, and the body remembers. Anything that shakes that clear-mindedness is a life-risking liability. Biles has always been able to power through possible mental roadblocks in gymnastics and in her personal life. She powered through when she ended up in foster care after being taken away from a mother who struggled with addiction. She powered through thousands of hours of grueling training; through injuries like a bone spur in 2013 and a shoulder strain in 2015. She powered through years of sexual assault and through endless attacks on her spirit as she relived that assault publicly.TKTKThe Indianapolis Star broke the news of Nassar’s longtime abuse of hundreds of young women and girls in 2016, followed up by another report revealing USAG knew about his conduct and had covered it up. Before then, the Biles we knew was quieter — diplomatic to everyone and singularly focused on the game. She showed up to meets, beat her competitors graciously, and went home, thanking everyone for a good time. The months that followed were difficult. “It was hard to be in the gym mentally some days,” she recalls. She kept the abuse to herself for two years; when she spoke out about it in 2018, her voice was a knife in the discourse. “I’ve felt a bit broken,” she wrote in a Twitter statement, “and the more I try to shut off the voice in my head, the louder it screams.” Every day for months, this was her life: headlines and news chyrons with her name next to Nassar’s, public events where she’d sign autographs for little girls in one moment, then address USAG via broadcast in another. Something in her self-perception shifted at this point; she was no longer willing to be gracious. You could see it in her eyes in 2019, ahead of the Nationals in Kansas City, when reporters asked her about the cover-up, as she tearfully lambasted USAG: “You had one job! And you couldn’t protect us.” She was no longer okay with being a champion ghost. She wanted those who caused her harm to see her as human.TKTKAmid all of this, she never lost a meet. And in some ways, she felt stronger than ever — the gym had become her safe space away from the world, and she was at the top of her game, even landing the Yurchenko double pike, a move so difficult no other woman has attempted it. While she trained for the Olympics, she went to therapy, where she learned coping mechanisms and to listen to how she was feeling day to day. By the time the Games rolled around, Biles recalls, she told her therapist, “I’m good enough to go. And they were like, ‘Yes, you’re good enough to go and do your stuff, but you have to come back.’ And I was like, ‘Nah, I’m good.’ ” She felt the wound had been closed, the injury fixed.TKTKShe stepped onto the flight to Tokyo with confidence. But there were variables she didn’t anticipate this time: COVID testing, breakthrough cases. “There was no crowd, no parents,” she explains. It was going to be harder, mentally, to get into the game. Once she arrived, anxiety set in. Everything will be okay, she thought, but she had a nagging feeling that things were not right. The coaches went through the typical pep talks, reminding each person of their unique purpose on the team, but the words weren’t landing with her the way they usually did. “Leading up to it, I got more and more nervous,” she says. “I didn’t feel as confident as I should have been with as much training as we had.”TKTKThe trouble started after qualifiers. She fumbled event after event. Biles and her coaches moved frantically to find fixes. They tried using foam pits and surfaces that might make her feel safer. Nothing worked. “I was not physically capable,” she says. “Every avenue we tried, my body was like, Simone, chill. Sit down. We’re not doing it. And I’ve never experienced that.” Biles is known in the sport for her independence. Even among coaching staff, she is respected for her ability to self-moderate, to pull back when necessary. But rarely does she pull back because she can’t do something. Things were already a bit rocky in the qualifying meet, the first event of the competition, where she fumbled the dismount on beam. By the time of her vault performance, two days later at the women’s team final, Biles knew something bigger was off. She went for a 2.5 flip and only completed a 1.5. It wasn’t just a technical error. She had the “twisties,” which is when an athlete’s mind and body lose connection and muscle memory fails to kick in.",

  content: "Cool people like cool things, which is why we asked cool person Taylor Lorenz to come on Perfectly Imperfect & redistribute her good taste.TKTKTaylor Lorenz is a Los Angeles based journalist covering memes, YouTubers, TikTokers, Twitch streamers, and more for the New York Times. Her deep curiosity of Internet culture has led to great pieces on everything from the text-heavy meme posts of pages like @on_a_downward_spiral and @lifes.a.bender, the word “Cheugy”, and @glamdemon2004’s rise on TikTok. Right now she’s hard at work on her upcoming book, Extremely Online, which charts the rise of the so-called \"creator economy\" or influencer economy. You can expect to find Extremely Online from Simon & Schuster in late 2022. Taylor has great taste and lucky for us, she’s here to tell us what she’s been into.TKTKWithout further adoTKTKTaylor Lorenz (twitter, instagram, tiktok)TKTK🐦: Hummingbird feedersTKTKOne of the most satisfying things I've gotten into during the pandemic is feeding hummingbirds. Early last year I set up a bunch of hummingbird feeders on my deck and I cannot recommend it enough. One, it helps the birds, many of whom are migrating over large urban landscapes, have enough food to make it through their journey. Two, it's extremely peaceful and meditative to watch birds. Hummingbirds are very territorial and you can watch them duck and war with each other for hours. If you're patient enough and develop enough of a relationship with them they'll even feed out of a feeder on your hand. TKTK🎶  FlowState.fm TKTKFlowState is an awesome daily newsletter that sends two hours of music that's perfect for working to. There's no algorithmic discovery, it's all human recommendations and they write a little blurb about each artist they feature. It consistently introduces me to new artists I didn't know and has helped me appreciate lots of new genres, especially in the ambient music realm. The newsletter also puts out custom mixes and private Spotify playlists for paid subscribers. TKTK📹  Channel 5 NewsTKTKChannel 5 News is one of the only media startups I'm excited about. People might remember Andrew Callaghan, Nic Mosher, and Evan Gilbert-Katz from their YouTube and Instagram show All Gas No Brakes. They parted ways with their management company last year and ever since they left they've really hit their stride. The group roves around America in a vintage news van reporting from the ground on events like a Pick Up Artist Bootcamp, L.A. punk shows, a Qanon conference, a white lives matter rally, and more. Andrew and his team produced some of the best on the ground coverage of big breaking news events last year and I can't wait to see what Channel 5 puts out next. TKTK🩸 Horror moviesTKTKOctober is my favorite month primarily because it's when all the good horror movies drop. Anyone who knows me well at all knows my deep affinity for horror. Early last year I put together this spreadsheet of recs featuring most of my favorite films. I have pretty bad and often debilitating anxiety but somehow that all melts away when I'm watching a horror movie. I watch between three to five horror movies a week. I know lots of people say they don't like horror as a genre, but I think it's all about finding the right type. Not every horror film is all blood and guts (though I do enjoy those too!). TKTK💧 La PiscineTKTKSpeaking of movies, if I could make a non horror recommendation La Piscine is on Criterion right now and it's great. It's essentially about a murder in the French countryside, but it's shot gorgeously and everyone is dressed in amazing clothes. I can't usually make it through movies with subtitles (I'm dyslexic, don't come for me), but this one is an easy watch and despite all the tension and drama there's very little dialogue. TKTK👟 Power walks  TKTKI feel like a lot of people got into walking early on in the pandemic but fell off. I really recommend making power walks part of your routine. They're great for meetings and calls, catch ups with friends, or they can be a social thing where you and your friends can go on walks together. They can be fast or meandering. In New York I'd go on long walks in Prospect Park and that is still my favorite place to walk, but in L.A. the Silverlake reservoir makes a great loop too. I'm trying to meet up with people for walks now instead of drinks. TKTK🌱 Robbie and Gary Gardening on YouTubeTKTKRobbie is my favorite YouTuber. She's a woman in her 50s or 60s (I think) and produces videos about gardening with her husband Gary. She's so positive and earnest and her videos don't feature any fancy editing or overproduction like most YouTube videos. She also feeds thousands of hummingbirds in her Southern California garden. Her videos will always put you in a good mood. TKTK🍴 Black Market PestoTKTKI have to be fair and give Casey Neistat credit for this one because he brought this pesto over to my house a few months ago and told me it would be the best pesto I've ever had. He was 10000% correct. Black Market Pesto is raw vegan pesto made with almonds rather than pine nuts. I cannot overstate how good this pesto is, I eat this stuff straight from the jar. It's made by this guy named Hunter Weiss in San Diego. For a while they were only delivering locally around the L.A. area, but I believe he's in the process of trying to organize a wider rollout according to his Twitter. For now, the pesto is sold out on their website and only comes in \"drops\" but you can leave your email to find out when they make more.
