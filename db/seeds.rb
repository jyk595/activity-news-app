More than a year later, many such shows have gone dark, as the world eagerly moves on.One exception to the boom and bust of the quarantine content cycle is the podcast “How Long Gone.” The show, which premiered in March 2020, was born out of a Twitter joke between Chris Black and Jason Stewart. Longtime friends, they began posting, three times a week, hourlong FaceTime calls with each other and a grab bag of famous-ish friends and acquaintances in media, fashion, music and film. Early guests included the actress Tavi Gevinson, the writer Cat Marnell, the singer Phoebe Bridgers and the playwright and screenwriter Jeremy O. Harris.Now, more than 200 episodes later, “How Long Gone” has become a staple for many media insiders, culture makers, very online people and even your average “bro” — making it a clubhouse for the chattering classes.Its mix of Twitter-centric water cooler talk, free-form bull session, and a deluge of takes “sprayed” by its hosts has pushed the podcast to outgrow its origin story. Within months of their first episode, the show reached monthly listener figures in the six digits, they cracked the top 50 on Apple’s comedy charts and were asked to host a new podcast for Spotify: “How Long Gone Radio.”It’s even earned them a special kind of celebrity.“People at Erewhon are starting to recognize us,” said Mr. Black, 39, of the trendy grocery store in Los Angeles, where he and Mr. Stewart live.“How Long Gone” billed itself as a “bicoastal elite podcast from old friends” in its inaugural episode. There is, to be sure, some truth to the bicoastal elite thing. Mr. Black works as a consultant for fashion brands like Thom Browne and writes for culture magazines; he keeps an apartment in New York City, where he used to live. And Mr. Stewart, 41, is a prolific podcaster on his own, having first made his name as a party D.J. with Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak crew in the early 2000s.During one recent episode featuring A.J. Daulerio, a former editor of Gawker and Deadspin, the pair opened the show by covering a spree of trending topics: a viral milk story published on Grub Street, milk crate challenges and the appearance of one of Mr. Black’s tweets (about the milk story) in a New York Post story.“The milk story was brilliant because everyone has an opinion on it,” Mr. Black said during the episode. “And it’s absolutely meaningless.”Once the giggling and verbal horseplay subsided, they yielded the floor to Mr. Daulerio, who talked about the drug abuse that marked his reign at Gawker and about his new Substack, which focuses on subjects like substance abuse and recovery. (Mr. Black sometimes uses the podcast to speak openly about his past struggles with drug abuse and his current sobriety.)Their conversation soon settled into a broader discussion of New York publishing, their preferred newsletter subscriptions and media consumption habits. Mr. Black is fond of print magazines and Airmail, Graydon Carter’s once-a-week email newsletter. Mr. Stewart is less interested in print media and prefers to listen to articles on the Pocket app.“This is my favorite New York media podcast,” Mr. Daulerio said at one point. He added with some wonder: “You guys can say ‘fire’ and ‘bro’ so effortlessly.”Attributing the show’s steady success to its insider-baseball-like chats or the hosts’ exaggerated takes on just about everything under the sun would miss the point. There’s likely a more simple explanation: the appeal of two grown men engaging in nontoxic masculinity.“It’s rare and special and eternally fun to listen to people who are really close, who can point out each other’s flaws in a healthy and positive way,” Mr. Stewart said, on a recent Zoom call with Mr. Black. “Negativity is not entertaining to us.”Mr. Black added: “Just in a lighthearted, fun way. I like punching up.”They are, of course, far from the first pair of friends to turn genuine rapport into digestible content. Last November, Vogue cited “How Long Gone” as proof of the rise of the “bro-cast,” but noted that the format had been popularized quite successfully by women-led shows like “Call Your Girlfriend,” hosted by two “long-distance besties,” long before the quarantine era.Another podcast built around a close personal rapport is “Red Scare,” hosted by Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova. The podcast’s focus is political and generally takes up a trolling critique of liberal feminism in all its forms, but Ms. Nekrasova attributes a large degree of the show’s success to the friendship that is centered in each episode. She came on “How Long Gone” last November after receiving an Instagram message from Mr. Black, whom she knew little about.And with so many podcasts operating like mere “friendship simulators,” as Ms. Nekrasova calls them, she was surprised by the ease with which Mr. Black and Mr. Stewart integrated her into their pop culture musings. “It’s clear what they have is real,” she said. “Most podcasts take a while to develop a friendship, especially when it’s front and center to the show. But it’s easy for them. They’re good at keeping that ball in the air.”At a ceaseless pace, they have leveraged their micro-celebrity to pursue their own low-stakes interests. Multiple runs of hats, tote bags and a $40 “Performance” Nalgene bottle — mostly designed by Mr. Stewart — have sold out, they said. They have released their own brand of “snapchilled” canned coffee, named Mudd, and for a short while, Angelenos could start their day with “the Goner,” a vegan breakfast sandwich made in collaboration with local chain Burgerlords.Still, they haven’t put their podcast behind a paywall, opting for more aesthetically aligned sponsorships with companies like the podcasting platform Anchor.FM. “We want as many people to hear this podcast as possible, and if you put a paywall up that’s not going to happen,” Mr. Black said.“People don’t really want to support us that much,” Mr. Stewart added, dryly.Nor have they fully abandoned their day jobs. Mr. Stewart consults for other podcasts, while Mr. Black works with fashion clients. With audiences hyper-attuned to all things that could be deemed performative, and listeners and viewers ever more cynical to the dynamics of self-branding, Mr. Black and Mr. Stewart seem to have dialed into the right frequency of realness.“There are loads of podcasts that are intelligent and well researched, but they don’t necessarily have people I wish I was hanging out with,” said Raven Smith, a columnist for Vogue, who has been a guest on the show.It was through a Thom Browne project that Mr. Harris, the writer, first met Mr. Black. The two quickly hit it off and Mr. Harris was invited onto the podcast, becoming one of its earliest guests.“There’s a casual intellect that moves past a lot of the performance that one sees in podcasts,” Mr. Harris said of the show’s hosts. “They have an overwhelming sense of curiosity in who you are and the world you’re a part of. And that’s what sets them apart. They are classic radio hosts.”Mr. Black and Mr. Stewart have yet to record an episode in the same room. However, this fall, they are planning to take the show into the real world after being signed by High Road Touring, a talent booking agency. “Goners,” as the show’s fans are referred to, will be able to see a “David Letterman-style” live show during an 11-city tour across the country. An Oct. 23 appearance at the Bowery Ballroom in New York is sold out.The podcast has a record deal now, too, with the independent label Jagjaguar, home to Bon Iver, Angel Olsen and other musicians. Jagjaguar will release the debut “How Long Gone” album as a part of its 25th anniversary celebration.Both hosts came of age toiling in the music industry — Mr. Black used to manage the pop punk band Cartel in the early 2000s — so their record deal fits squarely with their history.And more broadly, it also may indicate that a successful podcast, in a cultural moment marked by digital novelty, is a quick path to social cachet.“Through the pod we’ve been able to clearly see how to accomplish a lot of the dreams and goals in our lives,” Mr. Stewart said. “We’ve been able to pull from all the worlds we’ve been a part of and inject it into this experiment that we’re doing. Every little thing can be done the way you want to do it.”Much like their music industry debut, which, Mr. Black noted, will be released as a double compact disc.“It’s just a fun thing to do,” he said. “Tapes are corny. Vinyl is corny. CDs are cool.”Advertisement", link: "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/style/how-long-gone-podcast.html", is_read: false, user_id: demo.id)

On a Monday afternoon in September—just after the first day of school had let out—nine tiny models were milling around Brooklyn’s Herbert Von King Park in layers of Italian cashmere. The kids, a creative bunch, none of whom does this professionally, seemed remarkably unfazed by the flurry of activity that accompanies a fashion shoot: As photography and styling assistants flitted around them, they sipped from juice boxes, shared their Transformers, and scattered cheese snacks on the ground. Louie Nobuko Huelster, 5 years old, tested the durability of a pair of green velvet shoes by jumping from one row of bleachers to the next. A few others wriggled out of their knit pants when their parents weren’t looking.Even when approached by a masked stranger with a voice recorder, the kids maintained their cool. I asked Coralynn Agbasionwe, 5, how her outfit made her feel. “It makes me feel happy,” she told me, playing with the belt of a blue cardigan. “I only just tried it on, but I would wear it for, like, a Valentine’s Day. Normally, I wear dresses on Valentine’s Day, and then I put a little sweater on the top.” Seven-year-old Ava Lamb said she’d wear her turmeric-hued pants “to a party.” Like a birthday party? “No,” she said matter-of-factly. “Just a party.”The designers of these cozy, colorful ensembles are Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of the Row, the brand whose minimalist, trend-agnostic adult clothes occupy a very specific niche in the world of luxury fashion. Where other designers are constantly pivoting, piling on, and riffing off of one another, the Olsens remain monastically consistent. The Row’s first children’s capsule collection, which launches in their stores and on their website today, stays true to that philosophical core: “The items have to have a sense of practicality, ease, and comfort,” Mary-Kate told me. “We think of this for our main collections, but it’s even more important for kids. Over the past 10 years, we’ve personalized cashmere onesie and blanket sets for our clients and friends who have had kids. We wanted to explore that in a bigger way.” While neither of the 35-year-old sisters has children of her own, a lot of their friends have had kids during the pandemic, which helped spark the idea.From left: Monreau Paretti, Alasdair Browne, Coralynn Agbasionwe, Brontë Schneider, Langston Rhinehart-Williams, Dev Cope, Ava Lamb, Leo Arya Kelley, Louie Nobuko Huelster.

Talent: Alasdair Browne, Ava Lamb, Brontë Schneider, Coralynn Agbasionwe, Dev Cope, Langston Rhinehart-Williams, Leo Arya Kelley, Louie Nobuko Huelster, Monreau ParettiThe collection is made up of cashmere pants, crewnecks, belted cardigans, hats, and velvet slip-ons (a miniature version of an existing women’s style, and based on Venetian gondolier shoes). It ranges in size from 2 to 10 years, and in price from $390 to $790. Also in the mix: small cashmere hacky sacks, an extremely chic upgrade on a ’90s college campus staple. Unlike the conventional ones, which are stuffed with plastic beads, these are filled with pearl couscous. At the shoot, at least one model enjoyed pelting them at our creative director.None of the pieces is gendered—a refreshing departure from the norm. (Enter just about any children’s clothing store, and you’ll feel like you’ve stepped into a battle of ruffled florals and monster trucks.) “Kids are the heart of creativity,” Ashley said. “They should be able to pick and choose what they want to wear, no matter what.” Everything is also devoid of zippers, buttons, laces, and anything else that might make the clothes less comfortable, or make getting them on and off more difficult than it needs to be. Those features, along with the cheerful but still sophisticated color palette, were born out of conversations with tots throughout the design process. “Kids bring out a sense of playfulness. They were very vocal and opinionated about what they liked and didn’t like,” Mary-Kate noted. “We loved listening to their free minds.”The capsule also has a philanthropic element: Proceeds will be donated to charities in Los Angeles, New York, and London (cities where the Row has flagship stores) that support children’s health, education, and well-being. With successive collections, which will expand to become “a reflection of core and seasonal offerings,” per Mary-Kate, the Olsens hope to build upon their network. “The plan is to create a program that gives back in a significant and meaningful way,” Ashley said.So does that mean we’ll eventually see toddlers around Greenwich Village and Notting Hill wearing suede trousers and soft-shouldered merino wool coats? “We started the Row with a T-shirt,” Ashley noted. “This collection was started in a similar way—we are focusing on the basics and building from there.”", link: "https://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/the-row-kids-collection-mary-kate-ashley-olsen-interview", is_read: false, user_id: demo.id)

There are 13 species of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia River drainage that are endangered.Credit...William Mullins, via AlamySupported byBy Jim RobbinsNORTH FORK, Idaho — The Middle Fork of the Salmon River, one of the wildest rivers in the contiguous United States, is prime fish habitat. Cold, clear waters from melting snow tumble out of the Salmon River Mountains and into the boulder-strewn river, which is federally protected.The last of the spawning spring-summer Chinook salmon arrived here in June after a herculean 800-mile upstream swim. Now the big fish — which can weigh up to 30 pounds — are finishing their courtship rituals. Next year there will be a new generation of Chinook.In spite of this pristine 112-mile-long mountain refuge, the fish that have returned here to reproduce and then die for countless generations are in deep trouble.Some 45,000 to 50,000 spring-summer Chinook spawned here in the 1950s. These days, the average is about 1,500 fish, and declining. And not just here: Native fish are in free-fall throughout the Columbia River basin, a situation so dire that many groups are urging the removal of four large dams to keep the fish from being lost.“The Columbia River was once the most productive wild Chinook habitat in the world,” said Russ Thurow, a fisheries research scientist with the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station.Standing alongside the Salmon River in Idaho, Mr. Thurow considered the prospect that the fish he had spent most of his life studying could disappear. “It’s hard to say, but now these fish have maybe four generations left before they are gone,” he said. “Maybe 20 years.”Thirteen species of salmon and steelhead trout are listed as threatened or endangered in the Columbia basin, an area that includes parts of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana and British Columbia. Salmon are a keystone species in this region, critical as a food source for animals from bears to eagles to insects. That group of beneficiaries includes an endangered population of orcas, or killer whales, along the West Coast that survive by eating Chinook in the winter and spring, up to 30 a day. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Many experts believe the orcas are starving in large part because of the decline of wild salmon. This year alone, their number has dropped from 76 to 73, alarming conservationists and scientists. Last year, an orca mother carried a dead calf for 17 days on her back. She was presumed to be grieving.“The best thing you could do to get more spring Chinook for the orcas is to remove those four lower dams,” said Don Chapman, a retired fisheries scientist who worked as a consultant to the hydropower industry and defended the dams and mitigation efforts. He has since changed his mind about the dams: “They kill too many juveniles going downstream and some adults going back.”Salmon are swimming in warming waters, with uncertain consequences, according to a recent study. Breaching the dams also would help keep water temperatures cooler as the climate changes, Dr. Chapman said. Chinook, or king salmon, are huge, powerful fish, the largest member of the salmon family in North America. Spring-summer Chinook make an epic migration thousands of miles through the Columbia River to the waters surrounding Alaska’s Aleutian Islands, and then back to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains.Before the 20th century, some 10 million to 16 million adult salmon and steelhead trout are thought to have returned annually to the Columbia River system. The current return of wild fish is 2 percent of that, by some estimates.While farming, logging and especially the commercial harvest of salmon in the early 20th century all took a toll, the single greatest impact on wild fish comes from eight large dams — four on the Columbia and four on the Snake River, a major tributary. The four Snake River dams are used primarily to create reservoirs for the barging of Idaho’s wheat to ports. But the dams raise water temperatures and block travel migration routes, increasing fish mortality.Climate change also has raised both river and ocean water temperatures, which can be deadly to fish. In 2015, for example, unusually warm water killed an estimated 250,000 sockeye salmon.For decades, experts have tried to ameliorate the loss of the Columbia’s wild fish by installing ladders that allow the fish to swim around the dams, and by placing them in barges and trucks for transport around the dams. The massive efforts have not stemmed the decline, despite the fact that more than $16 billion has been spent on recovery over the last several decades.Now most scientists come down on the side of removing the dams. Last fall, orca researchers urged Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and the Southern Resident Orca Task Force, a state government panel, to begin removing the four dams on the Snake River to aid the starving whales. “Put simply, orca need more Chinook salmon available on a year-round basis, as quickly as possible,” they wrote, calling the removals “vital to ensure orca survival.”The federal agencies responsible for managing fisheries on the Columbia, though, maintain that removing the Snake River dams is not critical to the survival of salmon and that hatchery-reared fish have made up for the loss of the river’s wild fish for the orcas. The southern resident killer whales “do not distinguish between hatchery and wild fish,” the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement.The National Marine Fisheries Service is considering a proposal to kill up to 1,100 sea lions annually along the Columbia River, because they eat salmon as they gather to spawn.Those who want to keep the dams point to changing ocean conditions as a major factor in the decline of the salmon. Water temperatures have been unusually warm in recent years, which reduces salmon food sources. Federal officials just announced that the marine heat wave has returned this year.WASHINGTONMONTANA][][][][][][Portland][][LARGEDAMSNorth ForkMiddle ForkOREGONIDAHOWASHINGTONIDAHO][][][][][][][][LARGEDAMSPortlandMiddle ForkOREGONBy The New York TimesBut hatchery fish are not the same, said Deborah A. Giles, science and research director at Wild Orca, a group that studies and advocates for protection of the whales. Orcas evolved eating big wild fish, some 300 to 350 pounds a day. “Wild fish are much bigger and more lipid-rich,” she said. “Having to catch the equivalent of 350 pounds in hatchery fish, which are smaller and lower quality, expends significantly more energy. They have to work a lot harder for their meals.”Nutritional stress is part of the reason that the whales are in decline. About 70 percent of pregnancies among the southern resident orcas are lost before the calves are born, an alarmingly high figure, according to a recent paper.Since 2001, federal courts have taken the agencies responsible for protecting the salmon, including NOAA and the Army Corps of Engineers, to task for not doing enough to ensure the survival of the fish. In 2016, Judge Michael H. Simon of the Federal District Court of Oregon ordered a new plan to restore the species, saying previous efforts had violated endangered species and environmental laws. The ruling cited the agencies’ refusal to consider removing the lower Snake River dams. The plan is due in 2021. Federal and state agencies have released untold numbers of hatchery-reared fish to replace wild fish in the Columbia basin. But some experts believe that hatchery fish could adversely affect the genome of the remaining wild fish. In 2016, a study found that 723 genes were operating differently in the first generation of hatchery-reared fish than in wild fish, affecting such functions as the immune system and wound-healing, as hatchery-reared fish adapted to crowded conditions. Traits that wild fish lose by mating with hatchery fish may one day be important for adaptation to climate change, Mr. Thurow said. The Middle Fork population, here in Idaho, is one of the few without genetic influences from hatchery-reared fish.The extreme migration of the spring-summer Chinook salmon is one of the natural world’s great journeys. Before the dams were built in the 1960s and 1970s, the fish born in the Middle Fork were swept by strong spring currents 800 miles to the sea. The rivers moved them rapidly along, from six to 10 miles per hour, and the young fish reached the brackish waters of the Columbia River estuary in a couple of weeks. As they travel, the parrs, or young freshwater salmon, undergo a profound transformation called smoltification, becoming smolts able to thrive in saltwater. After leaving the river, the fish turn north and travel to the North Pacific, near the Aleutian Islands. They spend up to four years feeding at sea, and then those that survive the seagoing journey return to the mouth of the Columbia. Their physiological changes are reversed as they move upstream, and they again become freshwater fish. Picking up the scent of their natal stream, they fight the current, foregoing food on the grueling trip, gaining about 6,500 feet in elevation, and overcoming physical barriers in what biologists describe as a heroic journey. “I’ve seen them jump an eight-foot waterfall, and they are known to jump 12 feet,” said Mr. Thurow. “They are the definition of persistence.”Chinook are known as “high-fidelity” spawners, not only returning to the stream where they were born, but also often to the same shallows. Then the game is afoot: In their waning days, as males battle for dominance, females excavate a redd, a depression in the gravel riverbed. The female releases clusters of eggs as the male sidles up, releasing its sperm at the same time. The current mixes them, resulting in fertilization. The eggs are adhesive and stick to the gravel after they fall. The female buries them in an egg pocket. The mating is repeated multiple times; all told, some 5,000 eggs may be released by a single female. “By the times she finishes, she’s within a day or two of dying,” Mr. Thurow said. The next spring, the offspring emerge and make their own journey to the sea. Always a gauntlet, the migration now is far more deadly. The eight large dams along the Snake and Columbia rivers created 325 miles of slack water in reservoirs. The average speed of the water flowing downstream has dropped to less than 1.5 miles per hour, and it takes the fish far longer to reach the sea.When the parrs reach a reservoir on the way, they must swim instead of being pushed by the current, and often become disoriented and are more susceptible to predators. Delayed, they may go through smoltification at the wrong time.The young salmon eat plankton and insects. But the waters of the Pacific along the West Coast have experienced unusual warming — the so-called blob — which reduces the available food supply.Before the Snake River dams were built, three to six of every 100 fish that left their natal streams returned home, a ratio called smolt-to-adult return. Today that number is just under one. Biologists say it must reach four to rebuild the fisheries.It is not just orcas that are suffering because of the decline of salmon. An estimated 137 species rely on the surge of protein brought upriver by millions of fish each year. The salmon also provided phosphorous, nitrogen and other nutrients that nourish the great forests of the Northwest. Three-quarters of the nutrients in some trees in Alaska and British Columbia are derived from salmon. The Middle Fork of Salmon River will be critical as the waters of the Columbia warm, Mr. Thurow said. High-altitude streams are expected to warm less, and the Chinook here will find a cold-water refuge — and if they adapt, a base for repopulating other streams.“The outlook isn’t good, but these fish are what give me hope,” Mr. Thurow said. “Despite all of the obstacles, they are still here.”Advertisement", link: "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/science/chinook-salmon-columbia.html", is_read: false, user_id: demo.id)
